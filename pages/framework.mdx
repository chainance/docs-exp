## **1. Blockchain Infrastructure**
This layer manages the on-chain storage of all blockchain data, including account states, transaction history, and contract information.

### **1.1 Features**
- **State Management**:
  - Maintains the global state of the blockchain, including account balances, contract states, and the Merkle Patricia Tree structure for proof verification.

- **Efficient Storage**:
  - Uses a hierarchical key-value database (e.g., RocksDB) for high-performance data retrieval and writing.

- **Transaction History**:
  - Provides access to historical transaction data for auditing and analytics purposes.

### **1.2 Scalability Extensions**
- **State Sharding**:
  - Splits the global state into independent shards, allowing parallel read and write operations to improve scalability.

- **Cold/Hot Data Separation**:
  - Historical data (cold) is archived into cost-efficient storage solutions, while frequently accessed data (hot) remains in high-performance storage for low-latency operations.

- **Dynamic State Leasing**:
  - Unused contract states or inactive accounts are moved to an off-chain storage mechanism, freeing up resources for active participants.

## 2. Consensus Layer
The Consensus Layer is the foundation of the XONE Blockchain, responsible for maintaining network security, transaction finality, and validator coordination. 

### 2.1 Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Core Mechanism**:
    - Validators are chosen based on the amount of staked tokens, ensuring a high level of security and decentralization.
    - Staking incentivizes network participants (validators and delegators) to act honestly to earn rewards and avoid penalties for malicious behavior.

- **Validator Selection**:
  - Validators are dynamically chosen to propose and validate blocks. The selection probability is proportional to their staked amount.
  - Misbehaving validators are penalized through slashing, ensuring network integrity.

- **Delegator System**:
  - Delegators can stake tokens with validators, earning a portion of the rewards while indirectly securing the network.
  - A transparent mechanism enables delegators to switch validators if necessary.

### **2.2 Behavior Value Incentive (BVI)**
- **Definition**:
  - Behavior Value Incentive (BVI) is a mechanism that rewards users based on their meaningful actions on the blockchain, such as interacting with decentralized applications (DApps), contributing to governance, or facilitating network activity.

- **Key Features**:
  1. **User Interaction Incentives**:
     - Users earn BVI rewards by engaging with DApps, such as:
       - Completing tasks or milestones in traget applications.
       - Participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols (e.g., providing liquidity, staking, or borrowing).
     - Encourages healthy growth of the ecosystem by rewarding activity that adds value.

**Example: Rewarding DApp Interactions**
   ```javascript
   //The user receives 50 GV tokens for their activity.
{
  "action": "reward",
  "dapp": "XoneSwap",
  "user": "0xUserAddress",
  "behavior": "TokenSwap",
  "value": 50
}
     ```

  2. **Cross-DApp Interoperability**:
     - BVI is shared across interconnected DApps, creating a cohesive user experience. For example:
       - Rewards earned in a DeFi platform can be utilized in gaming or governance DApps.
       - Tokenized behavior values can be traded or used as collateral.

  3. **Social Interaction Rewards**:
     - Incentivizes social behaviors like inviting friends, voting in governance, or supporting content creators within the ecosystem.

- **Data Aggregation and Transparency**:
  - BVI is recorded on-chain, allowing transparent tracking and analysis of user behavior. Developers can integrate these metrics into their DApps for tailored reward systems.

### **2.3 Scalability Extensions**
- **Dynamic Validator Pool**:
  - Expands or contracts the validator set based on network activity, ensuring cost-efficiency during low activity periods and robustness during high load scenarios.

- **Behavior Scoring System**:
  - Implements a scoring system to rank user activities, providing weighted rewards based on the significance of the action (e.g., high-value DeFi interactions vs. routine transfers).

- **BVI Integration with Governance**:
  - Users with higher BVI scores gain greater voting influence in on-chain governance, promoting active and constructive participation.

    ```javascript
   const batch = [
  {
    to: "0xRecipient1",
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0"),
  },
  {
    to: "0xRecipient2",
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("2.0"),
  },
];

const tx = await signer.sendBatchTransactions(batch);
console.log("Batch Transaction Hash:", tx.hash);
     ```

### **4.2 Cosmos SDK Modules**

- **Sharded RPC Services**:
  - Distributes RPC requests across multiple gateway nodes, enabling horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.

### **5.3 Examples**
1. **Querying Account Balance**:
   - A user queries their balance via a wallet application:
     ```json
     {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "method": "eth_getBalance",
       "params": ["0xYourAccountAddress", "latest"],
       "id": 1
     }
     ```
   - The gateway fetches the balance from the blockchain state and returns:
     ```json
     {
       "jsonrpc": "2.0",
       "id": 1,
       "result": "0x1234567890abcdef"
     }
     ```

2. **Submitting Transactions**:
   - A transaction payload is sent via `eth_sendTransaction`, which the RPC layer processes, validates, and forwards to the blockchain.

  - Allows seamless connection of DApps to the XONE network via injected providers (e.g., `window.ethereum` in browsers).

### **6.2 Scalability Extensions**
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Supports batching multiple RPC calls in a single request, reducing network overhead.
- **Event Subscription**:
  - Enables real-time event monitoring (e.g., `eth_subscribe`), such as contract events, new blocks, or transaction statuses.
- **Cross-Chain Event Monitoring**:
  - Extends Web3 subscriptions to track IBC-related events, providing developers with unified tools for multi-chain operations.

### **6.3 Examples**
1. **Smart Contract Interaction**:
   - A DeFi DApp interacts with a liquidity pool contract:
     ```javascript
     const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);
     const balance = await contract.getPoolBalance();
     console.log(`Pool balance: ${balance}`);
     ```
   - The Web3 Interface translates this into `eth_call` requests for execution.

2. **Real-Time Event Tracking**:
   - Subscribing to a contract's events:
     ```javascript
     provider.on('Transfer', (from, to, value) => {
       console.log(`Transfer from ${from} to ${to} of ${value} tokens`);
     });
     ```
